# US 12 - Specify a new vaccine and its administration process

## 1. Requirements Engineering


### 1.1. User Story Description


_"As an Administrator, I intend to specify a new vaccine and its administation process."_



### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 


**From the specifications document:**

>	An Administrator is responsible for properly configuring and managing the core information (e.g.:
type of vaccines, vaccines, vaccination centers, employees) required for this application [...]

>   [...] several vaccines might exist, each one demanding a distinct administration process.

>   The vaccine administration process comprises (i) one or more age groups (e.g.: 5 to 12 years old, 13 to 18 years
old, greater than 18 years old), and (ii) per age group, the doses to be administered (e.g.: 1, 2, 3), the
vaccine dosage (e.g.: 30 ml), and the time interval regarding the previously administered dose.

>    [...]  between doses (e.g.: between the 1st and 2nd doses) the
dosage to be administered might vary as well as the time interval elapsing between two consecutive
doses (e.g.: between the 1st and 2nd doses 21 days might be required, while between the 2nd and the
3rd doses 6 months might be required).

>   [...] for each type of vaccine, several vaccines might exist,


**From the client clarifications:**


> **Question:** 
>   As to the interval between doses, what time format are we to use?
> **Answer:** 
	Number of days.

-

> **Question:** 
>  Which attributes does the Vaccine have (besides the ones refering to the Vaccine Type)?
> **Answer:** 
   Each vaccine has the following attributes: Id, Name, Brand, Vaccine Type, Age Group, Dose Number, Vaccine Dosage and Time Since Last Dose.


### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** All required fields must be filled in.
* **AC2:** When creating a vaccine, the vaccine type must exist.
* **AC3:** The age group intervals limits, the dosage, the time since last dose and the number of doses must be positive integers.
* **AC4** In the age group interval, the minimum age must be smaller than the maximum age.
* **AC5:** When creating a vaccine with an already existing designation, the system must reject such operation and the user must have the chance to modify the typed designation.


### 1.4. Found out Dependencies


* There is a dependency to "US12 - Specify a new Vaccine Type" since at least a vaccine type must exist to classify new vaccine being created.


### 1.5 Input and Output Data


**Input Data:**

* Typed data:
  - Vaccine ID
  - Vaccine designation
  - Vaccine brand
  - Age group interval limits
  - Dosage
  - Number of doses
  - Time interval between doses
* Selected data:
  - Vaccine type


**Output Data:**

- (In)Success of the operation

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1 		 |	... displaying the screen to the user? | CreateVaccineUI   |  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.           |

| Step 2 		 |	... request data? | CreateVaccineUI | IE: Responsible for user interactions.                            |
| Step 3  		 |	... instantiating a new vaccine? | VaccineStore   | Creator: R1/2.   |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Company
 * Vaccine
 * VaccineType
 * AdministrationProcess
 * DoseInformation

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 * CreateVaccineUI
 * CreateVaccineController

# 4. Tests 

* Vaccine

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Vaccine class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void NullVacArguments() {
		Vaccine instance = new Vaccine(null, null, null, null);
	}
	

**Test 2:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Vaccine class with empty values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void EmptyVacArguments() {
		Vaccine instance = new Vaccine("", "", "", "");
	}
	

**Test 3:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Vaccine class with a vaccine type id that does not exist. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void VacNonExistingVacType() {
		Vaccine instance = new Vaccine("Pfizerâ€“BioNTech COVID-19", "Pfizer", "vac1", "Not existing vacTypeID");
	}

* Administration Process

**Test 4:** Check that it is not possible to add an administration process with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void NullAdminProcArguments() {
		AdminProcess adminProcess = new AdminProcess(0, 0, 0);
	}

**Test 5:** Check that it is not possible to add an administration process with negative time interval values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void NegativeAdminProcArguments() {
		AdminProcess adminProcess = new AdminProcess(-10, -5, 3);
	}


**Test 6:** Check that it is not possible to add an administration process with a max age smaller than the min age values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void MaxAgeBiggerThanMinAge() {
		AdminProcess adminProcess = new AdminProcess(18, 2, 3);
	}

* Dose Information
  
**Test 7:** Check that it is not possible to add a dose information with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void NullDoseInfoArguments() {
		DoseInfo doseInfo = new DoseInfo(0, 0);
	}


**Test 8:** Check that it is not possible to add a dose information with negative time interval values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void NegativeDoseInfoArguments() {
		DoseInfo doseInfo = new DoseInfo(-10, -5);
	}


# 5. Construction (Implementation)


## Class CreateVaccineController 

		
	public class CreateVaccineController {
		private App app;
		private Company company;
		private VaccineStore vaccineStore;
		private VaccineTypeStore vaccineTypeStore;

		/**
		* Constructor for CreateVaccineController
		*/
		public CreateVaccineController() {
			this.app = App.getInstance();
			this.company = this.app.getCompany();
			this.vaccineStore = this.company.getVaccineStore();
			this.vaccineTypeStore = this.company.getVaccineTypeStore();
		}

		...

	}
